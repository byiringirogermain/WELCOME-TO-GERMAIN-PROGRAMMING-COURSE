An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the
 compiler or interpreter toperform specificathematicaelational or
  logical operation and produce final result. 
 This chapter will explain the concept of operators and it will take
  you through the important 
 arithmetic and relational operators available in C, Java, and Python.

Arithmetic Operators
Computer programs are widely used for mathematical calculations. We can
 write a computer 
program which can do simple calculation like adding two numbers (2 + 3) and 
we can also write 
a program, which can solve a complex equation like P(x) = x4 + 7x3 - 5x + 9. 
If you have been 
even a poor student, you must be aware that in first expression 2 and 3 are
 operands and + is an
 operator. Similar concepts exist in Computer Programming.
